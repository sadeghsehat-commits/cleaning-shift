COMPLETE FIX AND DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
==========================================

==========================================
PART 1: FIX XCODE ERROR
==========================================

The problem: Git is looking for Xcode at a path that doesn't exist.

Solution: Reset xcode-select and install command line tools.

Step 1: Reset xcode-select
sudo xcode-select --reset

(Enter your Mac password when asked)

Step 2: Install command line tools
xcode-select --install

What happens:
- Dialog appears
- Click "Install"
- Wait 5-10 minutes
- Installs ~1GB (NOT full Xcode)

Step 3: Verify it worked
xcode-select -p

Should show: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
(If it shows /Applications/Xcode.app, installation didn't work)

==========================================
PART 2: DEPLOY CHANGES
==========================================

After command line tools are installed:

cd /Users/LUNAFELICE/Desktop/Mahdiamooyee
git add .
git commit -m "Fix notification titles and click navigation for Android and PWA"
git push origin main

✅ Vercel will auto-deploy in 1-3 minutes

==========================================
ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS
==========================================

Q: What should "export PATH=..." return?
A: Nothing - it's normal. It just sets a variable silently.

Q: Why does git still show Xcode error?
A: Because xcode-select still points to deleted Xcode path.
   Need to reset and install command line tools.

Q: Why no deployment running?
A: Because git commands are failing due to Xcode error.
   Fix xcode-select first, then deploy.

==========================================
WHAT TO DO NOW
==========================================

1. Run: sudo xcode-select --reset
2. Run: xcode-select --install
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for installation
4. Then run git commands
5. Deployment will work

This is a ONE-TIME fix. After this, git will work forever.
