FIX XCODE ERROR - STEP BY STEP
==========================================

Your system still thinks Xcode exists at:
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

But Xcode was deleted, so git fails.

==========================================
SOLUTION: Reset and Install Tools
==========================================

Run these commands ONE AT A TIME:

Command 1: Reset xcode-select
sudo xcode-select --reset

(You'll be asked for your Mac password)

Command 2: Install command line tools
xcode-select --install

(Wait for dialog, click "Install", wait 5-10 minutes)

Command 3: After installation, verify
xcode-select -p

(Should show: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools)

==========================================
THEN DEPLOY
==========================================

After tools are installed:

cd /Users/LUNAFELICE/Desktop/Mahdiamooyee
git add .
git commit -m "Fix notification titles and click navigation for Android and PWA"
git push origin main

==========================================
WHAT export PATH DOES
==========================================

"export PATH=..." doesn't show output - this is NORMAL.
It just sets an environment variable silently.

But it's not enough - we need to fix xcode-select.

==========================================
QUICK SUMMARY
==========================================

1. sudo xcode-select --reset
2. xcode-select --install (wait 5-10 min)
3. Then git commands will work
