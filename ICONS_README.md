# PWA Icons Required

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create the following icon files in the `public/` directory:

1. `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixels
2. `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixels

These icons should represent your cleaning management app. You can:
- Use an online icon generator
- Create them in a design tool like Figma or Photoshop
- Use a service like https://realfavicongenerator.net/

The icons will be used when users install the app on their home screen.
