QUICK FIX FOR XCODE ERROR
==========================================

The Xcode error is blocking git. Here's how to fix it:

==========================================
STEP 1: Install Command Line Tools
==========================================

Run this command:

xcode-select --install

What happens:
- Dialog appears asking to install
- Click "Install"
- Wait 5-10 minutes
- Installation completes automatically

This installs ONLY command line tools (NOT full Xcode)
Size: ~1GB (not 10GB like full Xcode)

==========================================
STEP 2: After Installation
==========================================

Then run deployment commands:

cd /Users/LUNAFELICE/Desktop/Mahdiamooyee
git add .
git commit -m "Fix notification titles and click navigation for Android and PWA"
git push origin main

==========================================
WHAT export PATH DOES
==========================================

The command "export PATH=..." doesn't show any output.
This is NORMAL - it just sets an environment variable.

But it's not enough - git still needs command line tools.

==========================================
WHY THIS IS NEEDED
==========================================

Git on macOS uses some Xcode command line tools.
Even though you deleted Xcode, git still needs these tools.

Installing command line tools gives git what it needs
without installing the full Xcode app.

==========================================
AFTER INSTALLATION
==========================================

✅ Git commands will work
✅ No more Xcode errors
✅ Can deploy normally
✅ One-time installation (never need to do again)
